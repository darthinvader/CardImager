## **Core Gameplay Mechanics** ⚙️

### **Core Loop** 🔄
1.  **Start Turn:** Draw a fixed number of cards.
2.  **Action Phase:** Play cards by spending resources.
3.  **End Turn:** Discard any remaining cards in hand.

### **Resource System** 💎
*   **🏃 Actions:** The primary currency for playing cards.
*   **❤️ Health:** Your character’s life force. Reaching zero means defeat.
*   **🌟 Class Resource:** A unique meter for each class (e.g., Barbarian Rage, Wizard Mana).

### **Card Mechanics** 🃏
Every card includes an Action Cost, Image, Effects, and Card Type. Most cards have fixed, reliable effects, with a special subset of cards adding dice rolls for bonus randomness.

*   **Card Types:**
    *   ⚔️ **Attack:** Primarily deals damage to foes.
    *   🪄 **Spell:** Casts a magical effect, from damage to utility.
    *   ❤️‍🩹 **Heal:** Restores Health or removes negative effects.
    *   🛠️ **Skill:** Versatile cards used for non-combat challenges or unique combat actions.
    *   🌟 **Feature:** Cards that often grant passive or persistent effects.

### **Item Mechanics** ⚔️
*   🛡️ **Permanent Items:** Equipment that grants ongoing passive bonuses.
*   🧪 **Consumables:** Single-use items, like potions or poisons, that are played like cards and then consumed.

### **Class Mechanics** 🧙
*   **🪙 Unique Resource:** Each class has one special meter that fuels its core identity.
*   **📊 Primary Stat:** Two main ability scores that define a class's strengths.
*   **🧩 Subclasses:** Unlocked via progression, granting powerful new cards and expanding the class's unique "puzzle board." (Expansion content perhaps) 
*   **🎯 Unique Gimmicks:** Every class has at least two distinct focuses or strategies that make it feel unique.

### **Ancestry Mechanics** 👪
Primarily for flavor, each ancestry grants a character a unique starting `Skill` and `Feat` card.

### **Enemy Mechanics** 👹
*   **🎯 Target Selection:** Defines how enemies choose which party members to attack.
*   **🤖 Behavior Variants:** Different AI patterns, resistances, and special triggers that make enemies feel distinct.
* Minnions/Minibosses
* Minnions are avoidable, minibosses aren't.
* Final Boss
* Avoiding Enemies will trigger an effect, negative obv.

### **Quest Mechanics** 📜
*   **🗺️ Quest Structure:** The adventure consists of one main quest and two supporting side quests.
*   **🔗 Dependencies:** Completing side quests provides essential aid (e.g., items, allies, shortcuts) needed to progress the main quest.
* Instead of side quests, class quiests, or personal quests..!!!!

### **Status & Condition Mechanics**
*   **🐺 Statuses:** Persistent mechanics that stay with a character between encounters. They are distinct from equipment.
    *   *Example: A character transforms into a werewolf, gaining a permanent `Status` that alters their abilities for the rest of the run.*
*   **🤕 Conditions:** Temporary effects that are removed at the end of combat.
    *   *Example: An enemy is afflicted with a `Poisoned` `Condition`, taking damage each turn until combat ends.*

### **Encounter & Event Mechanics** ⁉️
*   **🏕️ Rests:** Opportunities to recover Health and resources.
* 3d6 vs 1d20 
*   **🛒 Shops:** Places to purchase new cards, items, or upgrades.
*   **🎲 Random Encounters:** Optional narrative events that may require a skill check to resolve.
*   **⚔️ Enemy Encounters:** Standard turn-based battles against foes.
Night Encounters: People not resting get night encounters
### **Player Progression** 🚀
1.  Select a class and build your starting deck.
2.  Win encounters to level up.
3.  On each level-up, gain one of the following:
    *   A new class card (ability or spell).
    *   Subclass cards or features at milestone levels.
    *   Feats (powerful neutral cards) at designated levels.

### **Win & Loss Conditions** 🏆
*   **✅ Win:** Complete the main quest line.
*   **❌ Loss:** The entire party is defeated, or the main quest becomes impossible to complete.

## **Design Decisions** 🧠
*   **🎲 Counters:** Use physical counters with different icons and numbers (like 3D10s) to track Health and other resources.
*   **🧩 Class Board:** Each class has a personal "board" that expands with puzzle-like slots from subclass choices.
*   **📥 Item Slots:** Permanent items must be physically fit onto the class board, creating a fun inventory management puzzle.
*   **🎒 Potion Bag:** Consumable potions are kept in a separate bag, not on the board.
*   **🤪 Character Creator:** A fun, silly character creator based on mixing and matching a set number of bodies, heads, and hair styles (e.g., 10x10x10).
