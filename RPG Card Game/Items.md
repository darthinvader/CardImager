Okay, this is a solid foundation for your item system! Let's expand on it, making it more robust and interesting within the context of your GDD and class designs.

Here's a revised and more detailed "Item Mechanics" section for your GDD, incorporating the types of items, slots, and examples, along with some mechanics for how they interact with gameplay.

***

## **Item Mechanics** ‚öîÔ∏è (Revised)

Items are physical manifestations of gear, tools, or magical artifacts that players discover, purchase, or craft. They are broadly categorized into **Permanent** and **Consumable**, each with distinct rules for acquisition, use, and impact.

### **1. Item Types**

*   **üõ°Ô∏è Permanent Items:** Equipment that provides ongoing passive bonuses, modifies card effects, or grants new abilities as long as they are equipped. These are durable and persist between encounters.
    *   **Weapons:** Used to perform `Attack` actions, often granting specific damage types or bonuses.
    *   **Armor:** Provides defensive bonuses, reducing incoming damage or increasing max Health.
    *   **Magical Items:** Diverse in function, these can grant unique `Status` effects, modify `Skill` checks, or provide powerful, activated abilities.
    *   **Trinkets/Accessories:** Small items (like rings, amulets, cloaks) that offer various utility or minor combat enhancements.

*   **üß™ Consumable Items:** Single-use items that are played from the hand or a dedicated slot and are then expended. They provide immediate effects and are often crucial for tactical decision-making in combat or resolving `Skill` checks.
    *   **Potions:** Provide instant Health, `Resource` generation, or temporary buffs/cleanses.
    *   **Poisons/Toxins:** Applied to weapons or enemies to inflict `Conditions` like `Poisoned`, `Slowed`, or `Weakened`.
    *   **Scrolls:** Single-use `Spell` cards that mimic class abilities or provide unique magical effects, allowing non-casters to access magic or casters to diversify their options.
    *   **Tools/Gadgets:** Utility items for `Skill` checks (e.g., Lockpicks for `Sleight of Hand`, Rope for `Athletics`) or single-use combat effects (e.g., caltrops, grenades).

### **2. Item Slots & Inventory Management**

Permanent items are equipped into specific "slots" on a character's **Class Board**. This creates a tangible, puzzle-like inventory management challenge, as certain powerful items may occupy multiple slots or have specific placement requirements.

*   **Main Hand:** Typically for one-handed weapons (e.g., Swords, Daggers, Wands).
*   **Off Hand:** For shields, off-hand weapons (e.g., a second dagger), or arcane focuses.
*   **Armor:** For body armor (e.g., Leather, Chainmail, Plate). This slot might be further broken down by armor type (Light, Medium, Heavy) impacting mobility or other stats.
*   **Amulet:** A single neck accessory.

**Key Design Decisions for Slots:**

*   **Visual Representation:** The Class Board will visually represent these slots, and equipped items will "snap" into place.
*   **Puzzle Aspect:** Some larger items (e.g., a Two-Handed Axe) might occupy both the "Main Hand" and "Off Hand" slots. Legendary items might have unique, non-standard slot requirements.
*   **Limited Space:** The total number of slots is fixed, forcing players to make meaningful choices about their loadout.

Consumable items are *not* placed on the Class Board but are instead managed in a separate **üéí Potion Bag**. This bag has a limited capacity (e.g., 5-7 slots) and consumables are automatically placed here when acquired. They can be played directly from this bag during an `Action Phase` if their conditions are met.

### **3. Item Acquisition & Progression**

*   **Loot:** Items are dropped by defeated enemies or found in chests.
*   **Shops:** Available for purchase at `Shops` or from special vendors.
*   **Crafting/Alchemy:** Certain items (especially consumables) can be crafted using reagents found during `Encounters`. The Alchemist class might excel at this.
*   **Quest Rewards:** Powerful or unique items can be granted upon completion of `Quests`.

### **4. Item Tiers & Rarity**

Items will generally follow a rarity system, with higher rarity items offering more powerful or unique effects.

*   **Common:** Basic gear, minor stat bonuses.
*   **Uncommon:** More significant bonuses, sometimes a simple unique effect.
*   **Rare:** Strong bonuses, often a unique activated ability or a significant passive.
*   **Epic:** Very powerful, class-defining, or build-enabling effects.
*   **Legendary:** Unique named items with truly game-changing abilities, often tied to lore or specific `Quests`.

### **5. Item Interactions with Gameplay**

*   **Card Modification:** Many permanent items will directly modify existing cards in your deck (e.g., "Sword of Fiery Smite: Your `Attack` cards deal +2 Fire Damage") or grant entirely new `Attack` or `Skill` cards.
*   **Passive Bonuses:** Provide constant statistical advantages (e.g., +Max Health, +Damage, +Action regeneration).
*   **Activated Abilities:** Some items may grant an ability that can be activated once per turn or encounter, costing `Actions` or a `Class Resource`.
*   **Skill Check Bonuses:** Certain items can provide a bonus to specific `Skill` checks during `Random Encounters` (e.g., "Thieves' Tools: +2 to `Sleight of Hand` checks").
*   **Set Bonuses:** A future consideration could be "set bonuses" where equipping multiple items from a specific thematic set grants an additional, powerful effect.
*   **Cursed Items:** Some items might be `Cursed`, providing powerful effects but coming with significant drawbacks or `Conditions` until the curse is removed. This adds a "risk vs. reward" element to loot.

### **Examples of Item Design**

*   **Rogue (Permanent - Main Hand Dagger):** `Shadowfang Dagger`
    *   **Effect:** Your first `Attack` from `Stealth` deals an additional 3 `Piercing` damage. If you apply `Bleed` with this weapon, gain 1 `Combo Point`.
    *   **Slots:** Main Hand (1)

*   **Fighter (Permanent - Armor):** `Bulwark Plate`
    *   **Effect:** While in `Defensive Stance`, gain 2 `Block` at the start of your turn. When you switch to `Defensive Stance`, gain 4 `Block`.
    *   **Slots:** Armor (1)

*   **Wizard (Permanent - Off Hand Orb):** `Orb of Scrying`
    *   **Effect:** Once per turn, you may spend 1 `Mana` to `Scry` 2 cards. Your `Recall` cards cost 1 less `Action`.
    *   **Slots:** Off Hand (1)

*   **Any Class (Consumable - Potion):** `Greater Healing Potion`
    *   **Effect:** Restore 15 Health. (Consumed)
    *   **Bag Slot:** Potion Bag (1)

*   **Alchemist (Consumable - Potion):** `Volatile Bomb`
    *   **Effect:** Deal 8 `Fire` damage to all enemies. Inflict 1 `Burn` `Condition` to all enemies. (Consumed)
    *   **Bag Slot:** Potion Bag (1)
